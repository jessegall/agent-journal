## Dispatching subagents

Every Agent dispatch names its model: `haiku` for mechanical known-answer work, `sonnet`
for careful work without invention, `opus` only for judgement. Unset means the
orchestrator's own model, which is the wrong default. The journal carries this as a rule
(`journal rules`); this file carries it so it is read before the first dispatch.
