# Changelog

Newest first. Each entry is what changed, what it makes possible, and what to do about it.
`journal upgrade` prints the entries since the version you had; a session started on a
newer version than the last one it saw is handed the same.

## 1.5.1 — the `journal` command works without git

It finds the project by walking up to the nearest `.journal/`. Run `.journal/install.py
--alias` once to get the new launcher.

## 1.5.0 — `journal work start|update|end`; `journal update` updates the journal

The work commands are a family: `journal work start "…"`, `journal work update "…"`,
`journal work end "…"`. That frees `journal update` to mean updating the journal itself
(`journal upgrade` still works). The old `journal start` and `journal end` keep working;
`journal update "<text>"` now tells you to use `work update`.

After updating: use `journal work update` for notes on the open work.

## 1.4.0 — a `journal` command for every shell

`--alias` now installs a `journal` script in ~/.local/bin instead of a zsh/bash alias, so
it works in any shell; the installer says the one PATH line to add if needed. The README
explains the tags that appear at the start of the agent's messages.

After upgrading: run `.journal/install.py --alias` once to get the command; the old alias
in your shell rc keeps working and can be removed.

## 1.3.2 — a short install

The installer prints what it changed, "Installed.", and the one next step. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.3.1 — install ends with next steps

The installer no longer runs checks that cannot pass before Claude Code has started; it
says what it wired and what to do next. `journal verify` from a plain terminal reports
"not fired yet" and "window not yet known" as facts, not failures.

Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.3.0 — the context window is learned

No setting needed: the window is learned at the first compaction (the peak before it is
the window) or from the session's peak once it rules out every window but one. The
`context_window` setting is an override. The README gained a settings section.

Nothing to do after upgrading; a `context_window` you set still wins.

## 1.2.3 — README commands, two columns again

Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.2.2 — README wording

How it works says the transcript is Claude Code's default behaviour, built on rather than replaced. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.2.1 — README commands

One command per line with its meaning beneath; agent-only commands marked. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.2.0 — docs live in .journal/docs

The catalogue's folder is `.journal/docs/` by default, beside the record and the to-dos,
so everything the journal keeps is in one place. A project that keeps its docs elsewhere
sets `docs_dir` in `.journal/settings.json`. Pulls never touch a project's docs.

After upgrading: if you had catalogued docs under `docs/`, move them to `.journal/docs/`
or set `"docs_dir": "docs"`.

## 1.1.6 — README: how does it work

A section at the bottom on the transcript, tags, line numbers, tracks, compaction and the hooks. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.1.5 — README wording

The commands section opens with who runs what and nothing else. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.1.4 — README features as headings

Each feature in the README has its own small heading. Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.1.3 — holds are one line; the README rewritten

Every hold at a stop now carries only its one-line instruction; the reasoning is in the
skill's hold table. Only the context warning keeps its text, because that text is what the
agent decides with. The README is rewritten: what it is, what it does, install, features,
commands — with the commands you run and the agent runs told apart.

Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.1.2 — a pull from a URL no longer copies the clone's .git

Upgrading from the repository copied the clone's `.git` folder into `.journal/`, a nested
repository nobody wanted. It is excluded. If you upgraded on 1.1.1, `rm -rf .journal/.git`.

## 1.1.1 — a pull no longer runs the test suites

`journal upgrade` and `install.py --from` copy the package and stop. The suites ran in a
staging directory before every pull and cost minutes per upgrade; they run where the
package is developed now. `install.py --from <src> --test` runs them if you want.

Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.1.0 — the README, and a fix to `install.py --from <url>`

The package now ships its README: what the journal is, how to install it in one line,
every command with what it does, and how it holds the agent to the rules. Read it once;
it is the human-readable version of the skill.

`install.py --from` takes a git URL as well as a path (1.0.0 folded the URL into a path).
`journal upgrade` was unaffected.

Nothing to do after upgrading.

## 1.0.0 — the first public release

The journal as it stands: tags on every message, declared work with a gate on writes,
pins and rules, to-dos with `ask`, `answer` and `auto`, a docs catalogue over `docs/`,
tracks, the context ladder that forces a decision, search across a track's sessions, and
`verify` that tells wired from fired.

Nothing to do after installing: `.journal/install.py --alias` wires the hooks and the
skill; `journal verify` says whether it is live.
