        A secret names a key or a login, says what it is for and how to use it, and lists the
        commands it may be given to. Its values live in a file in your home folder, outside the
        project, and never in the journal.
    """

    help = """
        When a task needs a key or a login you do not have, ask for it with journal secret request
        "<name>" "<why>" [--kind "api key"|login|custom]: it waits on the Secrets page until the
        user fills it in. Never ask the user to paste a value into the chat, and never read the
        file that holds the values.

        Use a secret with journal secret run <name> -- <command>: the command gets the hidden
        value on its standard input, a home folder of its own so it keeps no login behind, and
        its output comes back with every form of the value replaced by [secret <name>]. --stdin
        "<text>" sends that text instead, with {<field>} filled in, such as --stdin
        "Authorization: Bearer {key}" for curl -H @-; --env gives the fields as environment
        variables instead. A secret never goes to a shell, an interpreter or a build tool, only
        to the programs it lists, and to helpers and subagents only when the user shared it. journal secret all lists the secrets with their descriptions,
        instructions and fields; journal secret read <n> shows one. A value you made yourself,
        such as a generated password, is written to a file and moved into the secret with
        journal secret store <n> <field> <file>, which deletes the file.

        The values live in one file per project under your home folder, owner-only, never in git,
        the attic, a worktree or a backup of the record; journal secret where prints its path.
        A deleted secret keeps its values for 30 days, then they are removed from the file.

        For a site you use in a browser, never type a password into a page: ask with journal
        secret request "<site>" "<why>" --kind "browser login" --url <address>. The chat shows
        the user a Log in button; only they press it, a browser opens on the address, they log in
        and close it, and the card says they are logged in. The session is saved beside the
        values file, and the agent's browser tools start logged in from their next start: Claude
        Code's Playwright server in the project's .mcp.json (the one already there, or one the
        journal adds), any other Playwright tool Claude Code starts, such as a Playwright plugin,
        through the agent's environment, and Codex's Playwright server in the project's
        .codex/config.toml.
