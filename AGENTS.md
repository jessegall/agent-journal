# agent-journal

## Tests

The default commands carry no hand-written tests. `tests/test_every_action.py` loops over every registered resource type and every action on its controller, and `tests/test_the_gate.py` loops over every provider; between them they cover create, read, update, complete and the rest for every type.

A feature is allowed one test file, `features/<name>/test.py`, beside its `feature.py`, under 150 lines — the `check` rows scripts/checks/test_shape.py and scripts/checks/one_client.py hold both, with scripts/checks/funnels.py for bodies written twice (`journal check sweep`). It exists only when the feature does something the generated runs cannot see: a hold on writes, a nudge, a file on disk, a process. A feature that only adds commands has none.

## The journal's law

These rules ship with the journal and cannot be switched off.

**L1 — Every subagent dispatch names its model and chooses the least expensive model that reliably fits the work.**

Use a fast, economical model for mechanical work with a known answer, a capable general model for careful implementation, and the strongest model only when the task turns on difficult judgement. Inheriting the orchestrator's model is not a model choice. If the dispatch API cannot accept a model, that operation is exempt.

**L2 — Every subagent is bound to a concrete job; never dispatch a generic or default agent.**

Use the most specific available agent type whose declared purpose matches the assignment. On providers without agent types, give the dispatch a concrete task name and bounded prompt. If no suitable specialization exists, keep the work in the main agent instead of manufacturing an unscoped helper.
